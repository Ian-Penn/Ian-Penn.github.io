                            I am currently trying to make a text editor from scratch.</br></br>

Here are some projects I did in the past that I put on this website:</br></br>
* I made Tetris but with a twist, literally. This started as me trying to make a pre-processor for JavaScript.
Then I wanted to try using it to make something. I appear to have lost the code for the pre-processor, but I've used this HTML file as a prank a few times now.
The file is <a href="/tetris.html">here</a>.
